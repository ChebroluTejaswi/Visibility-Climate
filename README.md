### Dataset 
Dataset used: <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/jfk-weather-data/">Click Here</a>

### How it works?
The training data is clustered, and then I determined which model works best for each cluster.To make a prediction, we first determine which cluster the new data points are a part of, and then we use the trained model to make the prediction.
